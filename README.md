‚öôÔ∏è **Workflow Use** is the easiest way to create and execute deterministic workflows with variables which fallback to [Browser Use](https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use) if a step fails. You just _show_ the recorder the workflow, we automatically generate the workflow.

‚ùó This project is in very early development so we don't recommend using this in production. Lots of things will change and we don't have a release schedule yet. Originally, the project was born out of customer demand to make Browser Use more reliable and deterministic.

# Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/workflow-use
```

## Build the extension

```bash
cd extension
npm install
npm run build
```

## Setup workflow environment

```bash
cd workflows
uv sync
playwright install chromium
cp .env.example .env
```

## Run the cli

```bash
python cli.py --help
```

# Demos

## Workflow Use filling out form instantly

# Features

- üîÅ **Record Once, Reuse Forever**: Record browser interactions once and replay them indefinitely.
- ‚è≥ **Show, don't prompt**: No need to spend hours prompting Browser Use to do the same thing over and over again.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Structured & Executable Workflows**: Converts recordings into deterministic, fast, and reliable workflows which automatically extract variables from forms.
- ü™Ñ **Human-like Interaction Understanding**: Intelligently filters noise from recordings to create meaningful workflows.
- üîí **Enterprise-Ready Foundation**: Built for future scalability with features like self-healing and workflow diffs.

# Vision and roadmap

Show computer what it needs to do once, and it will do it over and over again without any human intervention.

## Workflows

- [ ] Nice way to use the `.json` files inside python code
- [ ] Improve LLM fallback when step fails (currently really bad)
- [ ] Self healing, if it fails automatically agent kicks in and updates the workflow file
- [ ] Better support for LLM steps
- [ ] Take output from previous steps and use it as input for next steps
- [ ] Expose workflows as MCP tools
- [ ] Use Browser Use to automatically create workflows from websites

## Developer experience

- [ ] Improve CLI
- [ ] Improve extension
- [ ] Step editor

## Agent

- [ ] Allow Browser Use to use the workflows as MCP tools
- [ ] Use workflows as website caching layer
